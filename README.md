This tool finds all the ships involved in any pvp interaction. It uses zKillboard to find kills, then verifies each one with the official EVE ESI for maximum accuracy. This process can be slow.

It analyses only the last active zkill esi page so 200 kill Id's

Install the addon and use the Shortcode "[eve_ship_analyzer]" on a page to be able to use the plugin
